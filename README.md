📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔹 1. Distribution of Dividend Yield

Most stocks have low dividend yields, making high-yield stocks rare.

A few companies offer exceptionally high yields, which may indicate higher risk or market inefficiencies.

🔹 2. Correlation Between Stock Price & Dividend Yield

No strong correlation found—low stock prices do not always mean high dividends.

Some low-priced stocks may be undervalued, while others pose higher risks.

🔹 3. Geographical Distribution of Dividend Yields

Some economies have higher average dividend yields, making them attractive for dividend investors.

Emerging markets may show higher yields due to economic instability, while developed markets tend to be more stable but moderate.

🔹 4. Risk vs. Return Analysis

High-yield stocks tend to be more volatile, meaning higher returns often come with greater risks.

Countries with high yield volatility may experience economic instability, regulatory changes, or market uncertainties.

✔️ Top dividend-paying stocks provide excellent income potential
✔️No strong correlation between stock price and dividend yield
✔️ Certain countries offer higher average dividend yields
✔️ Higher-yield stocks tend to be more volatile
